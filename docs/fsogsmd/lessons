========================================================

=== Things to keep ===

* General architecture of

 - modem class, creating a bunch of
 - channels, optionally delegating to
 - unsolicited handlers.
 - mediators encapsulating the dbus command specifics.

* Separation of responsibilities.

=== Things to change for fsogsmd ===

* Delegate channel i/o to a dedicated transport delegate in order to
  simplify talking to a simulator or a multiplexer library. [DONE]

* On systems with optional multiplexing, do not use PTYs, but rather
  directly talk (using the multiplexer as a library). [DONE]

* Per-command timeouts do not make sense; rather maintain a reasonable
  channel timeout (say 90 seconds or so) that gets reset on every incoming
  data. When we are actually waiting for an answer and it triggers,
  try to escalate resetting the parser and/or (transparently) relaunching
  the last command. [done in frameworkd] [DONE]

* Per-command retries _might_ make sense.

* Dragging an error callback around for every command does not make
  sense, if the error refers to channel errors (such as a timeout),
  as opposed to an actual command response error (which makes sense). [DONE]

* If there's no reliable way to detect unsolicited responses (such as
  a physical or a virtual RING line) _and_ the modem does not
  guarantee delaying them between a request and a response, then
  the low level parser needs to be fed a list of valid prefixes for
  every command. [done in frameworkd] [DONE]

* It _might_ make sense to define every AT command as a struct, including:
  * a list of valid prefixes,
  * a regular expression that groups values into elements,
  * a mapping of values to types.
  This could reduce quite some boilerplate code. [DONE]

* Try to treat channels equally. Send commands in a round-robin fashion
  (except those for which there is per-channel state) to improve latency
  and throughput.
