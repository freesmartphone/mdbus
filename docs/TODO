==libfsobasics==
* add SmartKeyFile.pathValue( section, key, constraints, defaultpath ) querying for a path from the configuration, 
  checking several whether the constraints are met; if not, return the default.
* make read/write a bit more flexible
** read/write: sometimes it should not complain, if there is no file
** read: sometimes it should just return a default string, if there is no file
==libfsotransport==
* More unit tests, add a MockTransport
* Find out how to make sure that we always read what's available from a transport before attempting to write.
* Rewrite command queue abstraction for more flexibility; there's too much ATisms in there; merge with MsmCommandQueue

==fsogsmd==
* do not open all channels concurrently; instead, open the first channel and wait until
  all the modem setup has been carried out. Only after that, open the remaining channels


==fsotdld==
===alarm===
* Should we support a customizable object path for alarm notifications?
* Should registered alarms be persistent in case the daemon dies or the system gets rebooted?
===source_ntp===
* Listen for default route changes; then trigger sync
* Sync regularly (configurable frequency)

==fsousaged==
* Suspend/Resume resources in parallel (pending async dbus)
* Intermediate Resume Tasks
