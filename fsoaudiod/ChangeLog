	Bump version to 0.10.0 and for all FSO dependencies too

	drop GITV as version postfix for all components

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_fowarder: fix killing of fsogsmd
	Before, running the alsaloop plugin prevented fsogsmd from
	  beeing killed, this fixes it.

	Bump required fso-glib version of all components to 2012.14.1

	Bump required vala version of all components to 0.14.2

2012-01-27  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	Bump required vala version of all components to 0.14.1 (which is wrong anyway)
	We're requiring at least vala 0.14.1 but in reality we need a bit more. There is currently
	a version 0.14.1.9 distributed by ourself which contains everything we need to compile the
	complete FSO stack with vala-0.14. You find it at
	http://downloads.freesmartphone.org/vala-0.14.9.tar.bz2

	fsoaudiod: configure.ac: add configurable libsamplerate dependency
	This is needed because the GTA04 audio forwarding plugin
	  depends on libsamplerate.

	Thanks to lindi on #openmoko-cdevel on the Freenode IRC servers:
	  Jan 25 18:53:50 <lindi-_>	GNUtoo: perhaps PKG_CHECK_MODULES(LIBSAMPLERATE, [libsamplerate]) in configure.in

	fsoaudiod: conf: gta04: update alsaloop.conf
	This new version add record capability and less CPU usage and latency

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_forwarder: fix CPU usage
	Without that fix the CPU usage is high on the GTA04 machine because at
	  FreeSmartphone.GSM.CallStatus.OUTGOING, the modem "sound card"
	  is not ready yet, which causes buffer underruns/overruns issues
	  which causes high CPU usage, which unfortunately stays accross
	  the whole call.

	fsoaudiod: add config for GTA04

2012-01-25  Denis 'GNUtoo' Carikli  <GNUtoo@no-log.org>

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_forwarder: make succesive calls work.
	Without that fix alsaloop exited right after starting after
	  the first call: that was caused by the global quit variable:
	  it was set to one after the first call to make alsaloop exit,
	  but it stayed one on the successive calls because it was initialized
	  only when alsaloop started for the first time.

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_forwarder: alsaloop.c: switch from exit to return
	without that the exit code could make fsoaudiod exit instead of just the forwarder.

	Thanks mrmoku on #openmoko-cdevel on Freenode IRC server for the idea:
	  Jan 14 13:40:23 <mrmoku>	GNUtoo: make those too a return and check for the value?

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_forwarder: fix restart when thread exits by itself
	Thanks to mrmoku on #openmoko-cdevel Freenode irc channel for noticing it:
	  Jan 14 13:26:40 <mrmoku>	GNUtoo: one suboptimal thing is... when start_forwarder exits by itself (without calling stop) alsaLoopThread won't be reset to null

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_forwarder: add mutex to protect threads and add more logging

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_forwarder: make alsaloop exit without exiting fsoaudiod
	Without that fix fsoaudiod quits when alsaloop exits

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_forwarder: better handling of the start/stop of the wrapper alsaloop
	Note that when the call stops fsoaudiod exits...
	That will be addressed in a new commit.

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_forwarder: add shut down and config file

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_forwarder: make it compile

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_forwarder: try to make it compile

	fsoaudiod: import files for making an alsaloop based alsa forwarder plugin for the om-gta04

	fsodeviced: herring: import alsa scenarios from fsoaudiod
	As per IRC we agreed not to ship fsoaudiod as default audio solution for the 2012.01
	release of SHR. fsoaudiod will be the default for the next release. Due to this fact we
	need to ship the alsa scenario files for the herring machine with fsodeviced.

2011-12-20  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	fsoaudiod: herring: don't ship alsa.conf until fsoaudiod is not supported by SHR

	fsoaudiod: never include comments in config files in the same line than config values

	fsoaudiod: cmtspeech: correctly free pcmin / pcmout

	fsoaudiod: cmtspeech: activate audio on OUTGOING call state already
	This is needed to actually hear the ringtone and seems to work
	fine now.

	fsoaudiod: cmtspeech: activate feeding of audio to modem
	initialize the silence_buffer once before enabling audio and
	use it to feed silence to the modem too.

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_cmtspeech: give writei the correct length when playing back modem data

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_cmtspeech: use a RingBuffer
	This adds a ringbuffer class and uses it to buffer audio from
	and to the modem. The part to the modem is still disabled to
	get playback right first.

	Gives horrible sound right now - lot's of alsa clicking noise.

	fsoaudiod: libcmtspeechdata.vapi: extend EventData

	fsoaudiod: some initial work on the alsa streamcontrol plugin

2011-06-29  Denis 'GNUtoo' Carikli  <GNUtoo@no-log.org>

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_cmtspeechdata plugin: try to handle buffer underruns in the buffers
	We have 2 pointers, a read pointer and a write pointers.
	  we can treat it like 2 buffers in the big buffers:
	  so we have a read buffer and a write buffer.
	  the length of both virtual buffer are 320 bytes.
	  Since alsa writei was faster than the modem, it tried to writei more than necessary
	  And the read buffer passed before the write buffer in the FIFO big buffer.
	  That is now beeing handled

	At some pointt there was a comparison of the pointers distance, that didn't take in account the fact
	  that a distance is always positive(for instance when a buffer cross the border and the other buffer
	  didn't cross it yet. that is also now handled.

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_cmtspeechdata plugin : fix fix buffer position handling ,add buffer position loggin to stderr, and fix buffer pointers

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_cmtspeechdata: fix issues during call release,improve audio quality
	Without this fix fsoaudiod can segfault or block during call release

	The audio quality fix is about not playing frames before they are ready:
	  Otherwise the playback threads plays back before the modem memcpy data to the
	  transefert buffer.

	cmthandler.vala: fix size of buffer,various other fixes, and disable readi for now
	Note that pcmout.recover seem to produce better sound quality than pcmout.prepare

	The recording thread was removed, intead the sound is recorded

	  Answering machine function(thanks DocScrutinizer (on the

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_cmtspeechdata plugin: fix buffer underruns
	We now handle buffer underrun,even huges ones:
	  I tested it on the nokia n900, making a call to the operator number,
	  with many mplayer instance playing a video,with DEBUG on in
	  fsoaudiod.conf and with the CPU at 250Mhz only. and while the sound
	  is not so pretty, it recover the errors and I continue to ear the
