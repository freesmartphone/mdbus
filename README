mdbus – DBus has never been that much fun!
===========================================================

This utility helps you to explore and interact with DBus
services on your system bus and session bus. Called without
any parameters, it will show the available services on the
selected bus. Given a service name, it will show the avail-
able objects exported by the service. Given a service name
and an object path, it will show the exposed methods, sig-
nals, and properties of that object.

mdbus2 -i drops you into a shell mode, where you can inter-
actively explore services and call methods using readline
command line completion and history.

mdbus2 -l drops you into the listener mode, where everything
that happens on the bus is monitored.

NOTE: Mickey's DBus Utility requires well-behaved services,
i.e. those which implement the DBus introspection protocol.
