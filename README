Note: Some of this code may need several Vala patches that have not been integrated into
an upstream Vala release yet. If you do not want to use our pregenerated source tarballs
(available from http://www.freesmartphone.org/sources), feel free to use our Vala mirror
at http://git.freesmartphone.org to compile the latest version of Cornucopia.
