This is the Vala/C reference implementation of the freesmartphone.org APIs,
codename 'Cornucopia'.

Please see http://www.freesmartphone.org/index.php/Cornucopia

=== The Cornucopia Libraries ===

The Cornucopia libraries contain utility functions for freesmartphone.org API implementors.

Paradigm: Test Driven Development

Note: Some of this code may need several Vala patches that have not been integrated into
an upstream Vala release yet. For this, we provide intermediate git snapshot tarballs at
available from http://www.freesmartphone.org/sources.

Build Order:

1. libfsobasics
2. libfsotransport
3. libfsoframework
4. libgsm0710
5. libgsm0710mux
6. libfso-glib
7. libfsoresource

NOTE: Although there is a top-level Makefile present, you rather want to build the individual
projects. The top-level Makefile is just a convenience for me :) [Patches to make a full
recursive autotools project out of it appreciated...]
