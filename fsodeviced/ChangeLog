	fsodeviced: kernel26_rfkill: add missing dependency to libfsosystem

2012-01-27  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	Bump required vala version of all components to 0.14.1 (which is wrong anyway)
	We're requiring at least vala 0.14.1 but in reality we need a bit more. There is currently
	a version 0.14.1.9 distributed by ourself which contains everything we need to compile the
	complete FSO stack with vala-0.14. You find it at
	http://downloads.freesmartphone.org/vala-0.14.9.tar.bz2

	fsodeviced: kernel26_rfkill: refactor code so we're not executing binaries for network configuration

	fsodeviced: kernel26_rfkill: we need an valid instance of the hashtable instances all the time

	fsodeviced: gta04 config: now that the rfkill plugin works on the GTA04, use it

	fsodeviced: kernel26_rfkill: add ifconfig and power save support for wifi
	The ifconfig and exec function were taken from the powercontrol_ifconfig
	  plugin.

	Note that I used harcoded GPS and FM rfkill values because they
	  are not even in the upstream vala
	  ( http://valadoc.org/linux/Linux.RfKillType.html )

2012-01-22  Denis 'GNUtoo' Carikli  <GNUtoo@no-log.org>

	fsodeviced: GTA04 config: fix installation of the config

2012-01-21  Denis 'GNUtoo' Carikli  <GNUtoo@no-log.org>

	As per IRC we agreed not to ship fsoaudiod as default audio solution for the 2012.01
	release of SHR. fsoaudiod will be the default for the next release. Due to this fact we
	need to ship the alsa scenario files for the herring machine with fsodeviced.

	fsodeviced: conf: openmoko: add alsa state files for the 2.6.39 kernel and make it the default
	The new files were obtained by running theses 2 commands on every scenario:

	  mdbus2 -s org.freesmartphone.odeviced /org/freesmartphone/Device/Audio org.freesmartphone.Device.Audio.PushScenario
	And then doing a diff between the old scenario and the new one,
	And then since the control names didn't change but only their position, I applied
	  the previous values to the same controls at a different position.

	fsodeviced: accelerometer: add back signal delay timer
	Add back the delay in the orientation_changed signal.
	Now only a signal is sent if the orientation remains unchanged for 1 sec.
	The delay can be changed in the config.

2011-02-23  Peter van de Werken  <pwerken-fso@a-eskwadraat.nl>

	fsodeviced: accelerometer: stateless orientation
	When flat we still reports the previous (when it was held) screen orientation.
	The orientation changed signal now sends the same info as the get_orientation
	method, i.e. the full orientations state.  This eliminates the need for the
	client to keep track of this state information.

	These messages are (also/still) compliant with the current dbus specification.

	fsodeviced: accelerometer: reimplement orientation
	Axis orientation is assumed to be that as of the freerunners top
	accelerometer.  The configurable variable deadzone is used to provide a range
	in which the orientation is not changed.  This removes the jittering between
	orientations when one of the axis is near its zero value.

	fsodeviced: accelerometer_lis302: remove the 1 sec timeout
	Remove the one second timeout.  Every time there was an input event the
	timeout got reset, i.e. no accelerometer data was passed on until the
	the device was perfectly still for more than a second.

	fsodeviced: accelerometer: always set orientation
	fsodeviced would fail on an assert when the dbus methode GetOrientation is
	called before the plugin has been enabled atleast once.

	fsodeviced: accelerometer_lis302: add duration sysfsnode
	Set the delay (in ms) between events the lis302dl kernel module generates.
	With this can control the amount of cpu fsodeviced uses when the accelerometer
	is enabled/generating events.

	fsodeviced: accelerometer_lis302: enable full_scale config variable
	Add the needed code to use the full_scale config variable.

	fsodeviced: accelerometer_lis302: add sysfs path to config
	The path to the sysfsnode can now be changed from the config file.

	fsodeviced: accelerometer_lis302: update sysfspaths to 2.6.34
	Update the accelerometer_lis302 plugin to the paths used in 2.6.34.
	Valid values for sample_rate are either 100 or 400, using 100 as
	default.  With full_scale at "2.3" the threshold stepping size is 18
	so set its default to 54 (3 * 18).

	fsodeviced: remove unused accelerometer code

	fsodeviced: lib/alsa: fix segfault
	Need to investigate how/why first_elem returns NULL, but for now this stops
	fsodeviced from segfaulting when the GetVolume or SetVolume dbus method is
	called.

	fsodeviced: include the .vala files with make dist
	Even though valac is not required when building from a dist-tarball,
	make does require the .vala files to be present.

2010-12-12  Denis 'GNUtoo' Carikli  <GNUtoo@no-log.org>

	fsodeviced: powercontrol_ifconfig: fix power saving modes
	Previously the following command was run:
	  ifconfig wlan0 power on
	The correct comand is:
	  iwconfig wlan0 power on
	That prevented PSM(power saving mode) from beeing set.

	The most usefull Power saving mode is a wifi feature that makes the router
	  buffer the packets for the device(so the wifi card can sleep
	  while the packets are beeing buffered) and then the device request
	  all the packets at once.
	See that video for more background on wifi and power savings:
	  http://free-electrons.com/pub/video/2009/elce/elce2009-ortiz-wifi-solutions-for-mobile.ogv

	Pratically speaking without that command the wifi card consume way too much power,
	  which affect massively the autonomy of the device.

	fsodeviced: fix(in configuration) the remote silence when answering a call
	The alsa routing resulted in a problematic issue:
	*someone calls you
	*fso routes the ringing to the external speaker:
	  ( The external speaker is usually used for hand-free calling
	  or for playing some music loud, it's not used for normal
	  phone conversations )
	*the phone rings
	*you press the answer button in SHR's phone GUI

	Then:
	You can't ear the remote person talking.
	(leviathan said that the remote person could ear you tough)

	Removing this routing fix that issue,but the ringing is done
	trough the current audio path, in other words:
	if you're on headphones, it'll ring on the headphones.
	(which can be desirable or not)

	fsodeviced: kernel26_rfkill: make it build again

	fsodeviced: catch up with libfsobasics

2009-11-28  Michael 'Mickey' Lauer  <mickey@vanille-media.de>

	fsodeviced: building the kernel26_rfkill plugin is now optional (and disabled by default), since it requires quite a current Linux kernel (2.6.31). To build it, pass --enable-kernel26-rfkill to ./configure

	fsodeviced: player_alsa: stop (a looping) sound, if requested

2009-11-27  Michael 'Mickey' Lauer  <mickey@vanille-media.de>

	is the current scenario. If the scenario being modified is not the
	current scenario, be aware that audible artefacts can occur during
	reloading.
	NOTE: We require libfsoframework 0.2.4 and Vala 0.7.8.2 now

2009-11-24  Michael 'Mickey' Lauer  <mickey@vanille-media.de>

	fsodeviced: kernel26_rtc: be more cooperative with /dev/rtc0
	This module will now only hold /dev/rtc0 while it is a) doing any operation
	(which is very short), or b) waiting for a pending alarm (in which case
	we do not want someone else to remove or change it behind our back anyways).

	if you are missing something in the RTC DBus API.

2009-05-25  Michael 'Mickey' Lauer  <mickey@vanille-media.de>

	fsodeviced: kernel26_powersupply: aggregate handles correctly when we don't have any power supply class devices

	fsodevice: kernel26_powersupply: compute status if we're AC-powered

2009-05-09  Michael 'Mickey' Lauer  <mickey@vanille-media.de>

	fsodeviced: kernel26_powersupply: send 'critical' and 'empty' status

	fsodevice: kernel26_powersupply: send org.freesmartphone.Device.PowerSupply.Capacity regularly

	fsodevice: kernel26_powersupply: send status signals

	fsodeviced: kernel26_powersupply: add AggregatePowerSupply object In contrast to fso1, fso2 will feature an aggregated power supply object that combines the status of all available power supplies. This will then be the only one sending out status signals. The individual power supply objects will continue to be present; their status can be requested manually, but they will not send signals.

	fsodevice: honor 'sysfs_root' attribute in top level config and compute paths based on it By using the sysfs_root attribute we can develop many parts of fsodevice that do their work using sysfs on the PC. Simply mount your neo's / to your PC (e.g. via sshfs) to /mnt/neo and then set [cornucopia] sysfs_root = /mnt/neo/sysfs
