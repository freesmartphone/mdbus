version 0.12
=====================================================================

* outstanding bugs scheduled for 0.12
* switch to vala 0.16.x
* we need a utility script to test the content of the distribution archives against what
  is stored in the git repository. If there is a not allowed difference than the archive
  should not marked as ready my `make distcheck`
* fsogsmd:
    * call forwarding
    * converence calls
    * emergency calls
        * how can we test this?
    * join/release/held/transfer calls
    * homezone API
        * needed anymore?
    * voice mails API
    * send generic/retricted SIM command
    * lockdown feature
        * it should be possible for a client to lock the whole modem for any access.
          Until the lock is set no other client than the one aquired the lock should be
          able to access the modem. If the lock is released other clients can access the
          modem again. Usable for doing firmware upgrade where no other program should be
          allowed to use the modem.
* fsotest re-design
    * rather than doing testing the unit-test style write a test agent which acts as a
      normal client but does every automatically like a normal UI would do.
      Testing correct behavior is done by defining checkpoints. If a checkpoint is not
      reached whole test procedure is aborted if the severity of the checkpoint is
      configured as critical.
    * furthermore it should be possible to test the daemons by using the dbus-daemon-proxy
      utility on a remote device to test the daemons running there.
    * do not use glib unit test framework anymore; current implementation gives us too
      much trouble with executing asynchrounous methods.
* API test coverage should be
    * 100% for org.freesmartphone.Usage
    * 50% for org.freesmartphone.GSM.*
