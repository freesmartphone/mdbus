 fsoinitd: a legacy-free minimal system initializer for modern systems
=======================================================================

fso-boot is an attempt to a) minimize userland boot time and b) get rid
of the full-fledged init system, which we usually don't need for smartphones.

It is aimed to be an init process replacement that can either run stand-
alone or be linked as a stub to any process that will then handle system
initialization. This is very important on some embedded platforms.

Things like sysvinit, udev, hal, and friends are having a negative impact
and are overkill for modern dbus-based service architectures. If I boot a
Linux-based smartphone, I don't want any
* runlevels
* initscripts
* inittab
* udev and friends.

fso-boot can be used as init process replacement. On startup, it does:

0.) mount virtual filesystems:
	* /proc
	* /dev/pts
	* /sys

1.) mount physical filesystems:
	* root file system
	* volatile filesystems

2.) bring up local networking:
	* lo
	* usb0
	* eth0
	* set hostname
	* set default route

3.) start a getty and/or ssh daemon

4.) launch the dbus system daemon

5.) (optionally) start a user session, i.e. X11, Framebuffer, etc.

This reduces the enormous complexity, but of course comes with a price
of (very) limited flexiblity. Where exactly we will draw the line has not
been decided yet, the first phase of this project is merely a proof of
concept to see how fast we can actually get.
